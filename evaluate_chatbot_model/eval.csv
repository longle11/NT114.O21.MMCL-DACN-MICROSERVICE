5,What is machine learning?,Machine learning is a subset of AI that enables systems to learn and improve from experience without explicit programming.,Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that enables systems to learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed. It uses algorithms to analyze and interpret patterns in data to make informed decisions or predictions. You can learn more about machine learning from sources like the official TensorFlow website: https://www.tensorflow.org/overview/machine_learning,4.7764210701,65,5,"The provided output closely aligns with the target in all significant aspects. It captures the essence of machine learning being a subset of AI that learns and improves from experience without explicit programming. The output also includes additional information, which does not deviate from the target's meaning, thus demonstrating a high degree of semantic similarity."
6,How does useEffect() work?,"The useEffect() hook tells React that your component needs to do something after render. React will remember the function you passed (we’ll refer to it as our “effect”), and call it later after performing the DOM updates.","useEffect() is a hook in React that allows you to perform side effects in function components. It helps in managing component lifecycle events like fetching data, updating the DOM, and subscribing to events. useEffect() runs after every render by default, but you can specify dependencies to control when it should run.

You can learn more about how useEffect() works in the official React documentation: https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-effect.html",1.3086190224,84,4,"The provided output aligns closely with the target. It covers the key aspects mentioned in the target, including the purpose of useEffect() hook, its role in managing component lifecycle events, and its default behavior. While it does not include every single detail from the target, it demonstrates substantial semantic similarity."
7,What does the static keyword in a function mean?,"Static members belong to the class, rather than a specific instance. This means that only one instance of a static member exists, even if you create multiple objects of the class, or if you don't create any. It will be shared by all objects.","The static keyword in a function means that the variable declared with static retains its value between function calls.

Source: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/static-keyword-cpp",0.8614120483000001,35,3,"The output has moderate semantic similarity to the provided targets. It correctly explains the concept of the static keyword in functions, which aligns with the target's explanation of static members belonging to the class. However, it does not fully capture the idea of static members being shared by all objects of the class, hence the moderate score."
8,What is the difference between multiprocessing and multithreading?,"Multithreading refers to the ability of a processor to execute multiple threads concurrently, where each thread runs a process. Whereas multiprocessing refers to the ability of a system to run multiple processors in parallel, where each processor can run one or more threads.","Multiprocessing involves running multiple processes simultaneously, each with its own memory space, while multithreading involves running multiple threads within the same process, sharing the same memory space.
